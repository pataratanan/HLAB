Backend Answers

1. I would start with create a new folder in the backend(Assuming we use nest.js) name it as "real-time"

Step to integrate 
 - Build API gateway that will aggregate data from the three main microservices(This gateway will act as a single entry point for the client(React.js frontend)

 - Use nest.js built-in HTTP module and use the library like Axios to make requests 

 - Implement caching in the API gateway using Redis in memory data store(Protect and Store Frequently Accessed Data Structures)

 - Implement WebSocket connections using Socket.io or a similar library in both NestJS backend and React frontend.(Use these WebSocket connections to push real-time updates to the client when data changes in any of the microservices.)

 - Optimize queries in the Postgres databases of each microservice to ensure fast data retrieval.


2. I would get more information from the project manager first. For example, How many team members we have? Then I would provide him/her the list of test strategy plan. 1. Goals 2. Plan 3. Setup Environment 4. Implement continuous testing such as CI/CD 5. Monitor and analyze results 6. Report

React Answers

1.
	- useCallback preventing unnecessary re-creations of the function on each render.

If we have 

  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [otherState, setOtherState] = useState(0);
  const incrementCount = () => {
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
  };

  const updateOtherState = () => {
    setOtherState(otherState + 1);
  };

We use it in the return JSX, both of that will re-crated on every render, But if we use useCallback and we put empty dependency array the function is created once and never changes

const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
const [otherState, setOtherState] = useState(0);

// Without useCallback(example provided above), this function would be recreated on every render
const incrementCount = useCallback(() => {
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
  }, []);

//and this function will be recreated only when otherState changes
const updateOtherState = useCallback(() => {
    setOtherState(otherState + 1);
  }, [otherState]);



2. 

import React from 'react';
import { render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
import UserProfile from './UserProfile';

describe('UserProfile', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    jest.resetAllMocks();
  });

  it('displays loading state initially', () => {
    render(<UserProfile userId="123" />);
    expect(screen.getByText('Loading...')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('displays user data when fetch is successful', async () => {
    const mockUser = { name: 'John Doe', email: 'john@example.com' };
    global.fetch.mockResolvedValueOnce({
      ok: true,
      json: async () => mockUser,
    });

    render(<UserProfile userId="123" />);

    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(screen.getByText('John Doe')).toBeInTheDocument();
      expect(screen.getByText('Email: john@example.com')).toBeInTheDocument();
    });

    expect(global.fetch).toHaveBeenCalledWith('https://api.example.com/users/123');
  });
