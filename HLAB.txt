1. I would start with create a new folder in the backend(Assuming we use nest.js) name it as "real-time"

Step to integrate 
 - Build API gateway that will aggregate data from the three main microservices(This gateway will act as a single entry point for the client(React.js frontend)

 - Use nest.js built-in HTTP module and use the library like Axios to make requests 

 - Implement caching in the API gateway using Redis in memory data store(Protect and Store Frequently Accessed Data Structures)

 - Implement WebSocket connections using Socket.io or a similar library in both NestJS backend and React frontend.(Use these WebSocket connections to push real-time updates to the client when data changes in any of the microservices.)

 - Optimize queries in the Postgres databases of each microservice to ensure fast data retrieval.


2. I would get more information from the project manager first. For example, How many team members we have? Then I would provide him/her the list of test strategy plan. 1. Goals 2. Plan 3. Setup Environment 4. Implement continuous testing such as CI/CD 5. Monitor and analyze results 6. Report
